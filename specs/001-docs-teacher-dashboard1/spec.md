# Feature Specification: Teacher Dashboard with Authentication and Navigation

**Feature Branch**: `001-docs-teacher-dashboard1`
**Created**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "@Docs/teacher-dashboard1.md"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A teacher needs to access the kanji study system to manage assignments, questions, students, parents, and view reports. The teacher logs in with credentials, navigates through a menu-based dashboard to access different management functions, and all pages are accessible only when authenticated. The interface must be responsive and mobile-first.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a teacher at the login screen, **When** they enter valid credentials (teacher1@teacher.com / Password!), **Then** they are authenticated and redirected to the dashboard
2. **Given** a teacher at the login screen, **When** they enter invalid credentials, **Then** they see an error message and remain on the login page
3. **Given** an authenticated teacher on the dashboard, **When** they click on "Assignments" in the top menu, **Then** they are navigated to the /assignments page
4. **Given** an authenticated teacher on the dashboard, **When** they click on "Question Management" in the top menu, **Then** they see a submenu with "Question Management" and "Hint Management" options
5. **Given** an authenticated teacher on the dashboard, **When** they click on "User Management" in the top menu, **Then** they see a submenu with "Student Management" and "Parent Management" options
6. **Given** an authenticated teacher on the dashboard, **When** they click on "Reports" in the top menu, **Then** they see a submenu with "Report 1", "Report 2", and "Report 3" placeholder options
7. **Given** an authenticated teacher on the dashboard, **When** they click on "Admin Functions" in the top menu, **Then** they are navigated to a mockup/placeholder admin page
8. **Given** an unauthenticated user, **When** they attempt to access any page other than login, **Then** they are redirected to an error page
9. **Given** a teacher viewing the dashboard on a mobile device, **When** the page loads, **Then** all UI elements are properly displayed and functional in mobile view
10. **Given** a teacher viewing the dashboard on a desktop, **When** the page loads, **Then** all UI elements adapt to the larger screen size

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a teacher's session expires while navigating the dashboard?
- How does the system handle concurrent login attempts with the same credentials?
- What happens when a teacher tries to access a deep-linked page without authentication?
- How does the menu behave on very small mobile screens (e.g., 320px width)?
- What happens when a teacher clicks multiple menu items in rapid succession?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Authentication
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a login screen that accepts email and password credentials
- **FR-002**: System MUST authenticate users with email "teacher1@teacher.com" and password "Password!" [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: This is hardcoded for now - what is the long-term authentication strategy?]
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain authentication state across page navigations
- **FR-004**: System MUST redirect unauthenticated users attempting to access protected pages to an error page
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow only authenticated teachers to access all pages except the login page

#### Navigation & Menu Structure
- **FR-006**: Dashboard MUST display a top menu bar with five top-level menu items: Assignments, Question Management, User Management, Reports, and Admin Functions
- **FR-007**: "Assignments" menu item MUST navigate directly to /assignments when clicked
- **FR-008**: "Question Management" menu item MUST display a submenu with two options: "Question Management" and "Hint Management"
- **FR-009**: "User Management" menu item MUST display a submenu with two options: "Student Management" and "Parent Management"
- **FR-010**: "Reports" menu item MUST display a submenu with three placeholder options: "Report 1", "Report 2", and "Report 3"
- **FR-011**: "Admin Functions" menu item MUST navigate to a mockup/placeholder admin page when clicked
- **FR-012**: System MUST relocate quick access links from the bottom of the dashboard to the top menu bar [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should the original quick access section be completely removed?]

#### Responsive Design
- **FR-013**: All screens MUST be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes
- **FR-014**: All screens MUST follow mobile-first design principles
- **FR-015**: Menu bar MUST remain accessible and functional on mobile devices [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should the menu collapse into a hamburger menu on mobile?]

#### Data Management
- **FR-016**: System MUST use dummy/mock data for all displayed information at this stage
- **FR-017**: System MUST NOT connect to real backend services or databases [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: When is real data integration planned?]

### Key Entities

- **Teacher**: The authenticated user who accesses the dashboard; has credentials (email, password) and permissions to access all management functions
- **Authentication Session**: Represents the logged-in state of a teacher; determines access to protected pages
- **Menu Item**: Represents navigation options in the top menu bar; can be top-level or submenu items, each with a label and destination
- **Assignment**: Entity accessible through the Assignments menu [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What attributes and behaviors does an Assignment have?]
- **Question**: Entity manageable through the Question Management submenu [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What attributes and relationships does a Question have?]
- **Hint**: Entity manageable through the Hint Management submenu [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How do Hints relate to Questions?]
- **Student**: Entity manageable through the Student Management submenu [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What student information needs to be managed?]
- **Parent**: Entity manageable through the Parent Management submenu [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How do Parents relate to Students?]
- **Report**: Entity accessible through the Reports menu [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What types of reports are needed and what data do they contain?]
