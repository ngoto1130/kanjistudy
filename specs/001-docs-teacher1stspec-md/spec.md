# Feature Specification: Teacher Dashboard Mockup

**Feature Branch**: `001-docs-teacher1stspec-md`
**Created**: 2025-10-05
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "漢字の読みを学習するための教師用の機能を作成する。ここで作成するのはモックアップのみ。機能の実装はログインも含めて行わず、すべてモックコードのみとする。このアプリは、ユーザーの種類によって、ログイン後に移動する画面が異なる。今回は教師がログインした際の画面のモックアップを作成していく。教師はログイン画面でログインを行うことができる。ログインするとダッシュボード画面が開き、ダッシュボード画面には生徒一人一人の学習の進捗状況を表すテーブルと、教師用の通知の一覧が表示される。その下には教師が行うことができる作業がメニューとして用意されている。教師用のメニューには- アサインメント作成- 問題管理- 生徒管理- 保護者管理- 学習状況レポート- 管理者機能がある。メニューに対応する各ページはすべてモックアップとして用意すること。"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-05
- Q: What specific metrics should the student progress table display? → A: Student name, study sessions count (学習回数 - number of learning sessions completed in the app), cleared questions count, accuracy rate - with time period filters (last week, last month, or custom range)
- Q: What information should each notification show? → A: Title, brief message preview, date, notification type icon
- Q: How should teachers navigate back from menu pages to the dashboard? → A: Top navigation bar with breadcrumbs (Dashboard > Current Page)
- Q: When a teacher has no students assigned, what should the progress table display? → A: Show empty table with column headers only
- Q: When there are no notifications to display, what should the notifications section show? → A: Empty message: "No new notifications"
- Q: Number of students per teacher? → A: Non-homeroom system - ~10 teachers, ~50 students total. Students attend sessions every 2 weeks to 1 month. Teachers are assigned to sessions (not to specific students permanently).
- Q: Notification types and priority levels? → A: Two main types: (1) Assignment completion notifications (student cleared all assigned kanji, needs new assignment), (2) System notifications (e.g., "Teacher X registered new student YYY")
- Q: Assignment workflow details? → A: Teachers assign 10-30 kanji per student. Students clear a question by answering correctly 4 consecutive days (configurable). When all assigned questions are cleared, teacher receives notification.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A teacher logs into the kanji learning application and arrives at their dashboard where they can see all students' learning progress at a glance (not just "their" students, as this is a non-homeroom system with ~10 teachers managing ~50 students collectively), check important notifications about assignment completions and system events, and access various teaching management tools through a menu system. All screens are mockups with no actual backend functionality - designed to demonstrate the user interface and workflow.

### Context
- **School System**: Non-homeroom model with approximately 10 teachers and 50 students
- **Session Frequency**: Students attend learning sessions every 2 weeks to 1 month
- **Teacher Assignment**: Teachers are assigned to individual sessions (not permanently to specific students)
- **Assignment Model**: Teachers assign 10-30 kanji per student; questions are "cleared" after 4 consecutive correct answers (configurable)

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a teacher on the login screen, **When** they enter credentials and submit, **Then** they are directed to the teacher dashboard (mockup login - no validation)
2. **Given** a teacher on the dashboard, **When** the dashboard loads, **Then** they see a table showing each student's learning progress and a list of notifications
3. **Given** a teacher on the dashboard, **When** they view the menu section, **Then** they see six menu options: Assignment Creation, Question Management, Student Management, Parent Management, Learning Status Report, and Administrator Functions
4. **Given** a teacher on the dashboard, **When** they click any menu item, **Then** they navigate to the corresponding mockup page
5. **Given** a teacher on any menu page, **When** they interact with UI elements, **Then** mock data is displayed (no real data operations)
6. **Given** a teacher on any menu page, **When** they view the top navigation bar, **Then** they see breadcrumb navigation showing "Dashboard > [Current Page Name]"
7. **Given** a teacher on any menu page, **When** they click "Dashboard" in the breadcrumb, **Then** they navigate back to the dashboard
8. **Given** a teacher with no assigned students, **When** the dashboard loads, **Then** the progress table displays column headers with no data rows
9. **Given** a teacher with no notifications, **When** the dashboard loads, **Then** the notifications section displays the message "No new notifications"
10. **Given** mock notification data, **When** displayed, **Then** it includes both assignment completion notifications (e.g., "Student X completed all assigned kanji") and system notifications (e.g., "Teacher Y registered new student Z")

### Edge Cases
- Custom date range filter allows selecting any arbitrary time period for student progress metrics
- Dashboard displays all ~50 students' progress (not filtered by teacher assignment, as this is a non-homeroom system)
- Mock data should reflect realistic scale: ~10 teachers, ~50 students total
- Assignment completion notifications should indicate which student needs a new assignment

- **FR-015b**: When there are no notifications, the notifications section MUST display the message "No new notifications"

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Teacher**: The primary user who logs in and accesses the dashboard; can view all students' progress (non-homeroom system with ~10 teachers managing ~50 students collectively); assigned to individual learning sessions rather than specific students
- **Student**: Learners whose progress is tracked and displayed in the teacher's dashboard table; approximately 50 students total; attend sessions every 2 weeks to 1 month
- **Assignment**: Learning tasks created by teachers for students; typically consists of 10-30 kanji per student (accessed via Assignment Creation menu)
- **Question**: Individual kanji learning questions managed by teachers; a question is "cleared" when answered correctly 4 consecutive days (configurable setting) (accessed via Question Management menu)
- **Notification**: Messages or alerts displayed to teachers on the dashboard; includes title, brief message preview, date, and type icon. Two main types: (1) Assignment completion (student cleared all assigned kanji, needs new assignment), (2) System notifications (e.g., "Teacher X registered new student YYY")
- **Progress**: Learning metrics for each student: study sessions count (学習回数 - number of times student completed a learning session), cleared questions count (number of questions answered correctly), accuracy rate (percentage of correct answers); filterable by time period (last week, last month, custom range)
- **Parent**: Guardians of students whose information can be managed by teachers (accessed via Parent Management menu)
