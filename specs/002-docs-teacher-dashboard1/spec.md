**Feature Branch**: `002-docs-teacher-dashboard1`
**Created**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "@Docs/teacher-dashboard1.md"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Input provided: Teacher login and dashboard implementation
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Teachers
   ‚Üí Actions: Login, navigate menu, access features
   ‚Üí Data: Teacher credentials (hardcoded initially)
   ‚Üí Constraints: Responsive/mobile-first, authentication required for all non-login pages
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [See Requirements section for clarification markers]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow defined: Login ‚Üí Dashboard ‚Üí Navigation
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí All requirements testable and marked where ambiguous
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Teacher user, Menu structure, Session
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí All clarifications resolved via /clarify session
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06
- Q: When an unauthenticated user tries to access a protected page, what should the error page display? ‚Üí A: Simple error message only ("Access denied" or "Please login")
- Q: For the teacher login session, how long should a session remain active before expiring? ‚Üí A: 30min access token and 28days refresh token
- Q: How should the top navigation menu behave on mobile devices? ‚Üí A: Hamburger icon that opens a slide-in drawer from the side
- Q: Should the system implement rate limiting on failed login attempts for security? ‚Üí A: No rate limiting (this is just a prototype with dummy data)
- Q: Should the system provide a way for teachers to manually log out? ‚Üí A: Logout button in the top navigation menu bar

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A teacher needs to log into the system to access their dashboard and navigate to various teaching management features. The teacher uses a mobile device or desktop browser, enters their credentials on the login page, and upon successful authentication, sees a dashboard with a top navigation menu providing access to assignments, problem management, user management, reports, and administrative functions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the teacher is on the login page, **When** they enter valid credentials (teacher1@teacher.com / Password!), **Then** they are redirected to the dashboard with a visible top menu bar
2. **Given** the teacher is logged in and on the dashboard, **When** they click "Assignments" in the top menu, **Then** they navigate to the assignments page (/assignments)
3. **Given** the teacher is logged in and on the dashboard, **When** they click "Problem Management" in the top menu, **Then** they see a dropdown with "Problem Management" and "Hint Management" options
4. **Given** the teacher is logged in and on the dashboard, **When** they click "User Management" in the top menu, **Then** they see a dropdown with "Student Management" and "Parent Management" options
5. **Given** the teacher is logged in and on the dashboard, **When** they click "Reports" in the top menu, **Then** they see a dropdown with placeholder options "Report 1", "Report 2", and "Report 3"
6. **Given** the teacher is logged in and on the dashboard, **When** they click "Administrative Functions" in the top menu, **Then** they navigate to a mockup/placeholder page
7. **Given** the teacher is not logged in, **When** they attempt to access any page except the login page, **Then** they are redirected to an error page
8. **Given** the teacher is on the login page, **When** they enter invalid credentials, **Then** they see an error message and remain on the login page
9. **Given** the teacher is logged in and on any page, **When** they click the Logout button in the top navigation, **Then** their session is terminated and they are redirected to the login page

### Edge Cases
- When a teacher's active session expires (after 30 minutes), the system should require re-authentication but may use the extended login state (valid for 28 days) to simplify the process
- What happens when a teacher tries to access a deep-linked URL (e.g., /assignments) without being logged in?
- On mobile devices, the drawer should close when a menu item is selected or when the user taps outside the drawer
- When a teacher clicks the browser back button after logging out, they should be blocked from accessing protected pages and redirected to the error page

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a login page that accepts email and password credentials
- **FR-002**: System MUST authenticate users with hardcoded credentials (teacher1@teacher.com / Password!)
- **FR-003**: System MUST create and maintain a login session after successful authentication with an active session duration of 30 minutes and extended login state valid for 28 days
- **FR-004**: System MUST redirect authenticated teachers to a dashboard page after successful login
- **FR-005**: System MUST display a top navigation menu bar on the dashboard (replacing the current bottom quick-access links)
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide five top-level menu items: Assignments, Problem Management, User Management, Reports, and Administrative Functions, plus a Logout button
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow teachers to navigate to /assignments when clicking the Assignments menu item
- **FR-008**: System MUST display a dropdown menu under "Problem Management" with two options: "Problem Management" and "Hint Management"
- **FR-009**: System MUST display a dropdown menu under "User Management" with two options: "Student Management" and "Parent Management"
- **FR-010**: System MUST display a dropdown menu under "Reports" with three placeholder options: "Report 1", "Report 2", and "Report 3"
- **FR-011**: System MUST navigate to a mockup/placeholder page when "Administrative Functions" is clicked
- **FR-012**: System MUST block access to all pages except the login page for unauthenticated users
- **FR-013**: System MUST redirect unauthenticated users to an error page displaying a simple error message (e.g., "Access denied" or "Please login") when they attempt to access protected pages
- **FR-014**: System MUST implement all UI components with responsive design and mobile-first approach; on mobile devices, the top navigation menu MUST be accessed via a hamburger icon that opens a slide-in drawer from the side
- **FR-015**: System MUST display appropriate error messages when login fails with invalid credentials
- **FR-016**: System SHALL NOT implement rate limiting on failed login attempts (prototype phase with dummy data)
- **FR-017**: System MUST provide a Logout button in the top navigation menu bar that terminates the teacher's session and redirects to the login page

### Key Entities
- **Teacher User**: Represents an authenticated teacher with access credentials; initially hardcoded but designed to support future database integration
- **Login Session**: Represents an active authenticated session; must persist across page navigations and provide authentication status
- **Menu Structure**: Represents the hierarchical navigation menu with top-level items and dropdown submenus:
  - Assignments (direct link)
  - Problem Management (dropdown: Problem Management, Hint Management)
  - User Management (dropdown: Student Management, Parent Management)
  - Reports (dropdown: Report 1, Report 2, Report 3)
  - Administrative Functions (direct link to placeholder)
  - Logout (button that terminates session and redirects to login)
